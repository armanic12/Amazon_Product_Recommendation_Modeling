# Amazon Product Recommendation Modeling

A model-based collaborative filtering project that recommends products based on a userâ€™s past purchases and ratings from similar users. The notebook builds an item similarity model using dimensionality reduction and correlation on the Amazon Beauty ratings dataset.

## Dataset
- Name: Amazon Beauty product ratings  
- Format: CSV
- Source: [Kaggle - Amazon Ratings Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/skillsmuggler/amazon-ratings)

## Project overview
- **Goal**  
  Recommend products to a shopper based on item similarity learned from historical ratings.

- **Approach**  
  1. Load and clean the ratings data.  
  2. Build an item-user matrix.  
  3. Apply TruncatedSVD to reduce dimensionality and capture latent factors.  
  4. Compute an item-item correlation matrix in the reduced space.  
  5. Select a product and rank similar products by correlation.  
  6. Return the top results after removing the selected product.

## Methods and workflow
- **Data loading and cleaning**  
  Read `ratings_Beauty.csv`, drop missing values, inspect shape and head.

- **Matrix construction**  
  Create an item-user utility matrix suitable for model-based collaborative filtering.

- **Dimensionality reduction**  
  Use `sklearn.decomposition.TruncatedSVD` to project the utility matrix into a lower-rank space. This step preserves key structure while reducing noise.

- **Similarity computation**  
  Compute an item-item correlation matrix from the reduced representation with `numpy.corrcoef`.

- **Recommendation logic**  
  Pick a product index, map to the correlation vector, filter out the selected product, apply a correlation threshold, and show the top recommendations.

## Tools and skills used
- Python  
- NumPy, pandas  
- scikit-learn (TruncatedSVD)  
- Matrix factorization  
- Item-item collaborative filtering
